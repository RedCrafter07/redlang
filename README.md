# redlang
A programming language made with JavaScript inspired by Kotlin (making variables constant)
The goal is to make a programming language with a very simple syntax.

## IMPORTANT
This language is not finished yet! You can use it for test purposes, but don't expect it to be perfect. And don't say I haven't told you ;)
